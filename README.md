Optional programming assignments for Stanford's crypto course on Coursera

This is a work in progress.

The first assingment was done using code::blocks, the rest will be completed using Microsoft Visual Studio

I realize there is the possibility that other students may use this cheat, but these assignments are optional and don't count toward completion.

Any feedback would be appreciated (including on my usage of git/github). I am newer to programming and git.
